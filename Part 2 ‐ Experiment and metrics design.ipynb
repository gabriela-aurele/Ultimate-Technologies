    "The key measure of success for this experiment would be the increase in the number of driver partners who regularly serve both cities after the toll reimbursement policy is implemented. This metric is crucial because it directly reflects the effectiveness of the policy in encouraging driver partners to be available in both cities, thereby reducing exclusivity and improving overall mobility between Gotham and Metropolis."

If the policy is successful, we would expect to see a significant rise in the proportion of driver partners who are active in both cities, indicating that the toll reimbursement has incentivized them to cross the bridge more frequently."
